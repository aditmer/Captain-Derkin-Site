# Branding Assets - Placeholder Files

⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Replace these placeholder files with your actual Captain Derkin branding assets.

## Required Files

### App Icons
- **app-icon-1024.png** (1024×1024) - Main app icon for stores
- **app-icon-rounded.png** (1024×1024) - Rounded corners version for Android
- **captain-derkin-shield.png** (512×512 recommended) - Shield logo for website header
- **feature-graphic-1024x500.png** (1024×500) - Hero/feature graphic for stores and website

### Favicons
- **favicon-32.png** (32×32) - Browser favicon
- **favicon-192.png** (192×192) - Android home screen icon
- **favicon-512.png** (512×512) - High-res PWA icon

## Design Guidelines

All assets should follow the Captain Derkin brand palette:
- **Navy**: #0B0E14 (primary background)
- **Gold**: #D9A441 (accents, buttons)
- **Tan**: #E7D7C5 (cards/frames)
- **Crimson**: #B6403C (callouts)
- **Off-white**: #FAF7F2 (text backgrounds)

The shield and captain's hat motif should be consistent across all branding.

## How to Replace

1. Export your final assets with the exact filenames listed above
2. Place them in this `/docs/assets/branding/` directory
3. Ensure file formats are PNG with transparency where appropriate
4. Optimize images for web (use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim)
5. Delete this README once all assets are in place

## Current Status

All files are currently **PLACEHOLDERS** and must be replaced before launch.
