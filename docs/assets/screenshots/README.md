# Screenshot Assets - Placeholder Files

⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Replace these placeholder files with actual Captain Derkin game screenshots.

## Required Files

### iOS Screenshots
- **ios-1.png** - Main gameplay screen showing card play mechanics
- **ios-2.png** - Special cards demonstration (2, 7, Joker in action)

### Android Screenshots
- **android-1.png** - Gameplay showing strategy and card choices
- **android-2.png** - Rank progression or rewards screen

## Screenshot Guidelines

### Recommended Dimensions
- **iOS**: 1242×2688 (iPhone 13 Pro Max) or 1290×2796 (iPhone 14 Pro Max)
- **Android**: 1080×1920 or 1440×2560 (standard Android ratios)

### Best Practices
1. **Show key features**: Special cards (2, 7, Joker), tactical gameplay
2. **Capture clean UI**: No debug overlays or placeholder text
3. **Highlight visual polish**: Show the game at its best
4. **Diverse scenarios**: Different game states, ranks, cards
5. **Consistent branding**: Navy/gold/tan color scheme should be prominent

### Image Format
- PNG format with no compression artifacts
- Actual device screenshots (not mockups)
- Landscape or portrait depending on game orientation
- Optimize for web while maintaining quality

## Additional Screenshots (Optional)

Consider adding more screenshots to showcase:
- Character selection screen
- Mission/progression system
- Tutorial or how-to-play overlay
- Victory/defeat screens
- Settings or customization options

## How to Replace

1. Capture screenshots on actual devices (iPhone and Android)
2. Export with the exact filenames listed above
3. Place them in this `/docs/assets/screenshots/` directory
4. Optimize images for web (aim for <500KB per screenshot)
5. Update screenshot count in HTML if you add more
6. Delete this README once all assets are in place

## Current Status

All files are currently **PLACEHOLDERS** and must be replaced before launch.
