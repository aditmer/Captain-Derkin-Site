# Character Assets - Placeholder Files

⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: Replace these placeholder files with actual Captain Derkin character portraits.

## Required Files

### Character Portraits (200×200 minimum, square format)
- **barnaby-bones.png** - Portrait of Barnaby Bones character
- **jolly-corbin.png** - Portrait of Jolly Corbin character
- **salty-sue.png** - Portrait of Salty Sue character
- **vera-vortex.png** - Portrait of Vera Vortex character

## Design Guidelines

### Visual Style
- **Nautical/military theme** consistent with Captain Derkin branding
- **Square format** (200×200 or higher resolution like 512×512)
- **Transparent or solid background** - transparent preferred for flexibility
- **Consistent art style** across all character portraits
- **Clear, recognizable features** that work at small sizes

### Color Palette
Match the Captain Derkin brand:
- Navy (#0B0E14), Gold (#D9A441), Tan (#E7D7C5)
- Each character can have unique accents while staying on-brand

### Character Personalities (as reference)
- **Barnaby Bones**: Cunning strategist, determined, tactical
- **Jolly Corbin**: Cheerful, optimistic, lucky
- **Salty Sue**: Battle-hardened veteran, experienced, tough
- **Vera Vortex**: Mysterious newcomer, unpredictable, chaotic

## Technical Requirements

- **Format**: PNG with transparency
- **Resolution**: Minimum 200×200, recommend 512×512 for Retina displays
- **Optimization**: Compress for web (aim for <100KB per portrait)
- **Aspect ratio**: 1:1 (square)

## How to Replace

1. Create or commission character artwork following the guidelines
2. Export as PNG files with the exact filenames listed above
3. Place them in this `/docs/assets/characters/` directory
4. Test that they display correctly on the website (circular crop applied via CSS)
5. Delete this README once all assets are in place

## Current Status

All files are currently **PLACEHOLDERS** and must be replaced before launch.
